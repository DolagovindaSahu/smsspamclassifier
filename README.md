# 📩 SMS Spam Detection Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based SMS Spam Classifier that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect whether an incoming message is **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Built using a labeled dataset of SMS messages.
- Includes full pipeline: text preprocessing → feature extraction → model training → prediction.
- A **Streamlit-based web app** is included for user interaction.
- Developed as part of my portfolio for a **Data Analyst interview**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Streamlit  
- **ML Model**: Multinomial Naive Bayes (with TF-IDF vectorization)  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit (runs locally or can be hosted)

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & EDA**:
   - Removed punctuation, stopwords, and performed tokenization.
   - Visualized spam vs. ham distribution and message length.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Used `NLTK` for stopword removal and lemmatization.
   - Applied `TF-IDF` vectorization for feature extraction.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trai
